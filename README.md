### Credits

In carrying out this project, I have made use of chat gpt for bugs identification and resolution.

https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html: I used this resources to understand how to use the to_string(), to_datetime(), index()  and several other methods

I have also checked out several github repos to see the techniques used to solve some of the problems. See links below
